RELEASE 1.0.0: Major rewrite
    Build system uses hatchling
    There is no longer any *default mask*: you are expected to provide the
        names of the files to process with optional wild characters.

        it keeps using one single line in names.log with its true original
        name
    Support Python versions above 3.9 (tested up to 3.12)
